    - This does not currently support indexes.

    - The column will always be added as nullable. Adding non-nullable columns in
      SQLite requires an elaborate and sensitive dance that we do not wish to attempt.
      https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html#making_other_kinds_of_table_schema_changes

    To avoid those limitations, instead of this function, consider this:

    1. Start with an empty database, or drop or rename the current table.
    2. Use SQLAlchemy's `metadata.create_all()` to create an empty table with the new
       schema, including the new column.
    3. Copy rows from the old table to the new one, populating the new column
