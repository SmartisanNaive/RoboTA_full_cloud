# Analyses Generation and Snapshot Testing

## Setup

1. Follow the instructions in [DEV_SETUP.md](../DEV_SETUP.md)
1. `cd analyses-snapshot-testing`
1. use pyenv to install python 3.13 and set it as the local python version for this directory
1. `make setup`
1. Have docker installed and ready

## Concepts

- If working locally the branch you have checked out is the test code/snapshots you are working with.
  - In CI this is the `SNAPSHOT_REF`. This is the branch or tag of the test code/snapshots that analyses generated will be compared to.
- The `ANALYSIS_REF` is the branch or tag that you want analyses generated from.

## Build the opentrons-analysis image

> This ALWAYS gets the remote code pushed to Opentrons/opentrons for the specified ANALYSIS_REF

- build the base image
  - `make build-base-image`
- build the opentrons-analysis image
  - `make build-opentrons-analysis ANALYSIS_REF=release`

## Running the tests locally

- Compare the current branch snapshots to analyses generated from the edge branch
  - `make build-opentrons-analysis ANALYSIS_REF=edge` this builds a docker image named and tagged `opentrons-analysis:edge`
    - this pulls the latest edge every time it builds!
  - `make snapshot-test ANALYSIS_REF=edge`
    - This runs the test. The test:
      - Spins up a container from the `opentrons-analysis:edge` image. ANALYSIS_REF=edge specifies the image to use.
      - Analyses as .json files are generated for all protocols defined in [protocols.py](./automation/data/protocols.py) and [protocols_with_overrides.py](./automation/data/protocols_with_overrides.py)
      - the test compares the generated analyses to the snapshots in the [./tests/**snapshots**/](./tests/__snapshots__/) directory

## Updating the snapshots

- Assuming you have already built the `opentrons-analysis:edge` image
- `make snapshot-test-update ANALYSIS_REF=edge`
  - This will update the snapshots in the [./tests/**snapshots**/](./tests/__snapshots__/) directory with the analyses generated from the edge branch

## Running the tests against specific protocols

> We are omitting ANALYSIS_REF=edge because we can, it is the default in the Makefile

- `make snapshot-test PROTOCOL_NAMES=Flex_S_v2_19_Illumina_DNA_PCR_Free OVERRIDE_PROTOCOL_NAMES=none`
- `make snapshot-test PROTOCOL_NAMES=none OVERRIDE_PROTOCOL_NAMES=Flex_X_v2_18_NO_PIPETTES_Overrides_BadTypesInRTP`
- `make snapshot-test PROTOCOL_NAMES="Flex_S_v2_19_Illumina_DNA_PCR_Free,OT2_S_v2_18_P300M_P20S_HS_TC_TM_SmokeTestV3" OVERRIDE_PROTOCOL_NAMES=none`

## Running a Flex just like `make -C robot-server dev-flex`

> This ALWAYS gets the remote code pushed to Opentrons/opentrons for the specified OPENTRONS_VERSION

```shell
cd analyses-snapshot-testing \
&& make build-base-image \
&& make build-rs OPENTRONS_VERSION=release \
&& make run-rs OPENTRONS_VERSION=release`
```

### Default OPENTRONS_VERSION=edge in the Makefile so you can omit it if you want latest edge

```shell
cd analyses-snapshot-testing \
&& make build-base-image \
&& make build-rs \
&& make run-rs
```

## Running the Analyses Battery against your local code

> This copies in your local code to the container and runs the analyses battery against it.

`cd PYENV_ROOT && git pull` - make sure pyenv is up to date so you may install python 3.13.0
`pyenv install 3.13.0` - install python 3.13.0
`cd <OPENTRONS_REPO_ROOT>/analyses-snapshot-testing` - navigate to the analyses-snapshot-testing directory
`pyenv local 3.13.0` - set the local python version to 3.13.0
`make setup` - install the requirements
`make snapshot-test-local` - this target builds the base image, builds the local code into the base image, then runs the analyses battery against the image you just created

You have the option to specify one or many protocols to run the analyses on. This is also described above [Running the tests against specific protocols](#running-the-tests-against-specific-protocols)

- `make snapshot-test-local PROTOCOL_NAMES=Flex_S_v2_19_Illumina_DNA_PCR_Free OVERRIDE_PROTOCOL_NAMES=none`

### Updating the snapshots locally

- `make snapshot-test-update-local` - this target builds the base image, builds the local code into the base image, then runs the analyses battery against the image you just created, updating the snapshots by passing the `--update-snapshots` flag to the test

### Add some protocols to the analyses battery

> The below instructions avoid needing docker and executing snapshot tests locally.

1. create new protocol file(s) in the [files/protocols](./files/protocols) directory following the naming convention in [files/README.md](./files/README.md)
1. add the protocol(s) to the [protocols.py](./automation/data/protocols.py)
1. `make format` (make sure you have followed setup instructions)
1. commit and push your branch
1. open a PR and add the label `gen-analyses-snapshot-pr`
1. when the snapshot fails because your new protocols don't have snapshots a PR will be created that heals.
1. merge the healing PR if the snapshots are as expected
1. get a review and merge! ðŸŽ‰ now your protocols are a part of the test

### Add a protocol with overrides to the analyses battery

> TODO when we have a more straight forward example
