## Opentrons Protocol Designer Changes in 8.4.0

**Welcome to Protocol Designer 8.4.0!**

This release adds support for the Absorbance Plate Reader Module and includes feature improvements and bug fixes.

### Bug Fixes

- Move steps added to a Flex protocol now use the gripper by default.
- Use matching X and Y offset values to aspirate and dispense during a Mix step.

All protocols created in Protocol Designer now require version 8.2.0 or higher of the Opentrons App to run.

### New Features

**Absorbance Plate Reader Module GEN1**

You can add an Absorbance Plate Reader Module GEN1 to deck slots A3-D3 on the Flex. You'll also need to use a gripper to safely move the lid on and off the module.

To use the Absorbance Plate Reader Module in your Protocol Designer protocol, add the following steps:

- an Absorbance Plate Reader step to close the lid using the gripper
- an Absorbance Plate Reader step to initialize the module without labware inside. Choose from a single or multiple wavelengths.
- an Absorbance Plate Reader step to open the lid using the gripper
- a Move step to place a plate in the module. Using the gripper is optional.
- an Absorbance Plate Reader step to read the plate using the same wavelength choices.

Data from the Absorbance Plate Reader Module is exported as a .CSV file and can be found on your Flex's detail page in the Opentrons Desktop App. Repeat the steps shown above to open the lid and remove the plate.
